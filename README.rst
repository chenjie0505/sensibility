    this repo at the ``cmput680`` tag:

    ::

        git clone --branch=cmput680 https://github.com/eddieantonio/training-grammar-guru.git

    Or switch to the tag in the already cloned repository:

    ::

        git checkout cmput680

    Then following the Install_ and Usage_ sections below.

.. _cmput680: https://github.com/eddieantonio/training-grammar-guru/tree/cmput680


Install
-------

Requires Python 3.6 and Node.JS >= 4.0.

Activate a virtualenv, if that's your thing. Then,

::

    pip install -r requirements.txt
    pip install -e .

Download the `model data`_ and copy the
``*.h5`` and ``*.json`` files into the directory you'll run the tool.

.. _model data: https://archive.org/details/lstm-javascript-tiny


Usage
-----

To suggest a fix for a file:

::

    $ ./detect.py suggest my-incorrect-file.js
    my-incorrect-file.js:1:1: try inserting a '{'
        if (name)
                  ^
                  {

To dump the model's token-by-token consensus about the file:

::

    $ ./detect.py dump my-incorrect-file.js
