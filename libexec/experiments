"""
Creates the cartesian product of all configurations.

Usage:

Include the generated Make rules in to your main Makefile.

    include experiments.mk

Create a rule in your Makefile that generates the appropriate file:

    experiments.mk: libexec/experiments
            $< > $@

Then you can run ALL of the experiments by issuing the command:

    make experiments

RECOMMENDED:

    Add the --jobs argument alongside the --keep-running option.
    Tweak --jobs=N to the largest N that will run on the machine.
